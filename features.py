"""
WEEK 3 STARTER — build the member-level feature table, then audit it.

`data/claims.csv` has one row per claim. A model needs one row per *member*.
This file is where you do that roll-up yourself, and then decide which of the
resulting columns you are actually allowed to feed a model.

Fill in every section marked TODO. When you run this file it should:
  1. Load data/members.csv and data/claims.csv
  2. Keep only claims that were actually approved
  3. Aggregate claims to one row per member
  4. Attach the is_high_cost label
  5. Write data/member_features.csv
  6. Print your feature audit

Run:
    python features.py

Check your work:
    pytest tests/test_features.py -v

#
# For EVERY column in AUDITABLE_COLUMNS, replace the ("TODO", "") placeholder
# with your verdict and a one-line justification:
#
#   "safe"           observable at prediction time, safe to use as an input
#   "leaky"          a restatement of the outcome; using it is cheating
#   "debatable"      observable in principle, but arguably inside the outcome
#                    window — say what your position is and why
#   "not_a_feature"  real column, but not a model input (id, date, the label
#                    itself, ...)
#
# The test suite will not accept an empty justification, and it will not accept
# a column in your model feature list that can reproduce the label on its own.
# The question to ask for each column is always the same one:
#
#     "On the day I need this prediction, do I already know this number?"
#
# A prediction is made to decide who to reach out to BEFORE the plan year's
# spending happens. Keep that timeline in mind.
